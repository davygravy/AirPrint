AirPrint emulation on Entware-ng with fewer hiccups

This intends to be a predictable, no-surprises, quick-starting, no-mess, no-fuss and relatively painless way to get AirPrint emulation working on an eligible Entware-ng equipped router or other device. I've tested it extensively on my TomatoUSB and MerlinWRT mipsel/mipselsf routers.  I have not tested it on ARM or other devices. SEE THE WIKI FOR DETAILS.
